 # Introduction

Created by Benoît Mandelbrot in 1974 from the Latin root fractus, meaning “broken” or “irregular”, a fractal figure is a mathematical object such as a curve or a line. “irregular”, a fractal figure is a mathematical object, such as a curve or a surfacesurface, whose structure is invariant to any change of scale.

Many natural phenomena - such as the appearance of cabbage - possess
approximate fractal shapes.

# Goal

We're now going to get to grips with the school's graphics library: MiniLibX! This library has been developed in-house and includes basic tools for opening windows, creating images and managing keyboard and mouse events.
This new project will be an opportunity to start using MiniLibX, to discover or use the mathematical notion of complex numbers, to tackle the issue of optimization in graphics programming, and to learn how to manage events.
