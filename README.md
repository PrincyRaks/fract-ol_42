 # Introduction

Created by Beno√Æt Mandelbrot in 1974 from the Latin root fractus, meaning ‚Äúbroken‚Äù or ‚Äúirregular‚Äù, a fractal figure is a mathematical object such as a curve or a line. ‚Äúirregular‚Äù, a fractal figure is a mathematical object, such as a curve or a surfacesurface, whose structure is invariant to any change of scale.

Many natural phenomena - such as the appearance of cabbage - possess
approximate fractal shapes.

# Goal

We're now going to get to grips with the school's graphics library: MiniLibX! This library has been developed by 42 school and includes basic tools for opening windows, creating images and managing keyboard and mouse events.
This new project will be an opportunity to start using MiniLibX, to discover or use the mathematical notion of complex numbers, to tackle the issue of optimization in graphics programming, and to learn how to manage events.

# Documentation

For the documentation Library Minilibx [here](https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/)

The subjects of this project is [here](https://github.com/PrincyRaks/fract-ol/blob/main/fr.subject.pdf)

I didn't finished the last bonus to complete the 125 points (Zoom follows mouse position ü•≤. Sorry)

## Test
You can test this project if you have compiler C in your device :

- `git clone git@github.com:PrincyRaks/fract-ol.git`
- open terminal and execute the following commands :
 - `tar -xf minilibx-linux.tgz`
 - rename the folder **minilibx-linux** to **minilibx**
- execute `make` for mandatory project and `./fractol`, you can watch the differents formats to execute differents fractals
- `make bonus` for bonus project and execute `./fractol_bonus`
