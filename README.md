 # Introduction

Created by Benoît Mandelbrot in 1974 from the Latin root fractus, meaning “broken” or “irregular”, a fractal figure is a mathematical object such as a curve or a line. “irregular”, a fractal figure is a mathematical object, such as a curve or a surfacesurface, whose structure is invariant to any change of scale.

Many natural phenomena - such as the appearance of cabbage - possess
approximate fractal shapes.
